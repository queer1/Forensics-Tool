The wxWidget and pcap libraries are required to compile and run the forensics
tool.

Both libraries (and their dependencies) are open source, meaning that all of
their source code is available for scrutiny to ensure their trustworthiness.
Anything malicious possibly added to the libraries will be able to be seen
and detected by the open source community, and they libraries would not be as
popular as they are.

The libraries are also popular ones, with wxWidgets being used for many popular
GUI applications, and pcap used in popular applications such as Wireshark. Both
libraries are also available on popular distribution repositiories, such as for
Ubuntu.

For information on compiling the forensics tool with its dependencies, see
INSTALL.txt.
